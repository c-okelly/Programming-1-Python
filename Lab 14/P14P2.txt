Due to the method I used for the first section I found two errors occouring.

When the input was increased the program eventully gave a recursion depth error once the limit reached 997.

The system stated RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded

When i increased the limits on the recursion depth python would eventully crash with a system error about 100000.

In compariosn the non-recursive function was able to keep functioning.
