I looked at two previous functions I had created for finding the factorial of a number.

The first was one that found the result in a non recursive way.

The second used recursion.

I found a method to time the running of function and also increased the maximum resursive depth allowd by the system

I used the number 10,000 for my tests.

Using this method I found that the recursive method took 0.006 of a second longer to run
